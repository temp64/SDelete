## Introduction

SDelete (Secure Delete) is a Microsoft Sysinternals command-line tool created to securely remove files and sanitize free disk space on Windows systems. Unlike standard deletion—which simply flags data as removed while leaving it recoverable—SDelete overwrites the underlying content, making data restoration nearly impossible. This helps ensure that sensitive information, including confidential documents or temporary files, is permanently eliminated.

SDelete supports several scenarios, such as securely removing specific files or directories, wiping free space to prevent recovery of previously deleted items, and working with both NTFS and FAT file systems. It can perform multiple overwrite passes for enhanced security and follows established secure-erasure practices, including the U.S. Department of Defense DoD 5220.22-M standard.

For system administrators, SDelete offers a dependable way to enforce data-protection policies on workstations and servers. It can be incorporated into scripts and automated workflows to maintain consistent and secure cleanup routines. As a purely command-line utility, SDelete remains lightweight, adaptable, and effective—making it a valuable tool for organizations and individuals committed to preventing data recovery and safeguarding sensitive information.
